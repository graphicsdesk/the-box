Since the start of the campaign, the box has been removed from job applications in 45 different cities and counties, including our own New York City after the <a href=\"https://fairchancenyc.wordpress.com/\">Fair Chance Act</a> went into effect in 2015. The policy also prohibits employers from asking applicants about their criminal history during interviews and from checking the applicant’s criminal background before making them a job offer."},{"type":"text","value":"“My previous experience with having checked the box was usually that ...

Columbia’s Center for Justice, tucked away at the end of the hallway on the second floor of Schermerhorn Hall, is an interdisciplinary center that strives to find alternatives to incarceration through community programs and with the help of other University bodies. It’s host to programs such as the Justice-in-Education Initiative, as well as opportunities for nontraditional paths of education.

A 2014 survey asked the heads of admissions of 300 colleges why they chose to include criminal background checks in their application process. Common reasons included reducing violence, protecting against liability, and reducing illegal drug use. While some argue that preventing justice-involved students from coming to campus is a useful and necessary measure, the study provides an alternate opinion. “Screening applicants based on their criminal histories, however, raises both public safety and social justice concerns,” it concludes. The study notes that the question could increase recidivism and “divert resources from more effective safety interventions.”"},{"type":"text","value":"“I think there are probably multiple ways to protect the universities from violent crimes on campus, which is a legitimate concern, while still being fair to people—applicants—who may have done something when they were in high school, that was stupid and illegal,” says Dr. Carol Runyan, a professor at the Colorado School of Public Health who contributed to the study."},{"type":"text","value":"Durrel Washington, a system-impacted individual who graduated from the School of Social Work in 2018 and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in social work at the University of Chicago, also believes a question on criminal history should not appear on university applications. “I feel like having a box kind of gives [the] administration a reason to say ‘no’ to some folks who might be deserving to take space on the campus.”"},{"type":"text","value":"Matthew Pierce, another author on the study, also acknowledges the concern of crime on campus. “It's a tricky issue,” he says. He points to the fact that students are put in a certain position of trust living together. “You want universities to kind of make sure that the people who are being put in those positions of trust are safe,” Pierce notes. However, he still believes overall that criminal history should not be a factor in admissions. “I think to the extent that criminal background checks pose a barrier for people with a criminal history to get a college education; that's very concerning.” Specifically, Pierce is concerned that these checks will create barriers for justice-involved individuals who want to obtain an education."},{"type":"text","value":"But though many want to see the box removed, some aren’t certain if its removal will have a positive impact. Christopher Medina-Kirchner, a doctoral candidate at GSAS studying neuropsychopharmacology is more hesitant to ban the question, worrying that it could lead to discrimination, as universities may still assume certain students have a record. He is not necessarily against banning the box, but rather wants to make sure it will not decrease the representation of justice-involved people in higher education."},{"type":"text","value":"Isaac Scott, a junior in General Studies who was formerly incarcerated, is also concerned that banning the box could have unintended consequences of racism in the admissions process.

According to Gilooly “One of the goals is to get as many of our Jie scholars … who can qualify to be able to matriculate to into General Studies,” which is part of the larger goal of expanding educational opportunities for the scholars."},{"type":"text","value":"Another initiative that seeks to end mass incarceration at Columbia is the <a href=\"https://justicelab.columbia.edu/\">Justice Lab</a>, which uses research, policy development, and community engagement to advance justice reform. Washington points to the Justice Lab, among other bodies like the Center for Justice, that demonstrate how Columbia serves as a leader in criminal justice reform."},{"type":"text","value":"The Center for Justice also offers opportunities for engagement with questions of mass incarceration through various channels. Scott works as an <a href=\"http://justiceineducation.columbia.edu/people/profiles/isaac-scott/\">Arts and Communications Specialist</a> at the Center for Justice. Scott, who is the program director of the center’s The Confined Arts, a platform for sharing the art of justice-involved artists, began creating art during his sentence. “I was making fine art … you fold them a Manila folder in like a half, the flap you fold in half and you can make like reading cards,” he says. Now, he has changed art styles. He later says, “When I came home I transitioned into doing graphic design and then I've gotten into doing film and media.”"},{"type":"text","value":"The Office of Multicultural Affairs, which serves undergraduates in Columbia College and SEAS, is another of the Center for Justice’s partners—co-sponsoring events and helping spread its message and resources. OMA has worked to increase accessibility for formerly incarcerated students. The Intercultural Resource Center, housed under the OMA, has also formed an anti-carceral committee in which students have pushed forward work on the prison industrial complex."},{"type":"text","value":"Jarrell Daniels, a first-year in General Studies, also works at the Center for Justice as a program manager of the Justice Ambassadors Youth Council. The program, he says, connects justice-involved youth in the age range of 18 to 24 “with different city officials from different agencies to co-author policy proposals at the conclusion of the eight-week period.”"},{"type":"image","value":{"width":"auto","caption":"Jarrell Daniels, a first year in General Studies","asset":"../assets/KateDellaPietra_CenterforJustice11_26_CDS-12.jpeg"}},{"type":"text","value":"A student in Teachers College, Robert Wright has worked at the Center for Justice since last March, the week after he was released from prison. Wright earned his <a href=\"http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/2018/06/14/sing-sing-columbia-university-congratulations-j-holder-robert-wright/\">bachelor's</a> degree from Mercy College while he was in Sing Sing Correctional Facility through the <a href=\"http://www.hudsonlink.org/\">Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison</a> program."},{"type":"text","value":"Wright remembers it being difficult to be able to take classes while incarcerated. “You had to be clean disciplinary,” he says. “You couldn't have gotten a ticket. And a ticket is kind of like any frivolous infraction in jail for anything from fighting to you had your blanket up over your walls.” Nonetheless, he persevered in order to break out of the repetition in prison. “If I wanted to expand my mind outside of how many LeBron scored yesterday or some war story that we're talking about happened years ago, the only way to stimulate my mind was to go to school or pick up a book,” Wright says."},{"type":"text","value":"While justice-involved and system-involved students did not all agree on how to get there, each one was focused on the same goal: Making higher education more accessible to those who were formerly incarcerated, and working towards solutions for the country’s mass incarceration problem. Through its many programs and initiatives, the University has aligned itself with those goals, but to some, the presence of the box on its applications casts a shadow over these efforts."},{"type":"text","value":"Despite the doors education has opened, some hurdles will always lie ahead. While Wright has goals to go into teaching, his conviction will create an additional barrier to entering the field. He will have to confront the box on future applications, like many others. It’s a prospect he does not look forward to."},{"type":"text","value":"“All that matters should be all my merits, what I've done,” he says."},{"type":"text","value":"<i>Enjoy leafing through our eighth issue!"},{"type":"text","value":"</i>"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye/issue/XXVII/7/\">Previous Issue</a> | <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye/issue/XXVII/8/\">More In This Issue</a>"}],"USE_EYE_NAV":true,"USE_COVER_HED":true,"DOC_URL":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jf0OS6l0BlwpUHFGm_yShZ33KjZrOrNeGUZ0971Mexk/edit"}
